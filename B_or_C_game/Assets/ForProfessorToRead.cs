	// Yeah, I couldn't really keep up with this class
	// I don't think it's really what i want to do anyway
	// Probably could have done better overall if circumstances this semester were different
	// But I'm sure you don't want to hear any excuses

	// So, this is the entirety of what I managed to put together on my own
	// It took a long time to come up with a game i actually wanted to make
	// A simple Ice Cream Shop Simulator
	// I guess I have the basic ideas of how scripting works
	// kinda
	// What I have is generally clunky and confusing, I bet
	// And in the end, there's just way too much to tie together and make it work
	// at this point, I don't care enough to pull an all-nighter or something, trying to finish
	// No offense to you or the class or whatever
	// I'm probably going to change my major
	// I'm just not cut out for the computer-y stuff

	// Anyway, thanks
	// Jade
